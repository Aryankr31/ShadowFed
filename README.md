# 🛡️ ShadowFed
### **Synchronized & Encrypted learning**

---

## 📖 **Overview**
**ShadowFed** is a privacy-preserving **Federated Learning (FL)** framework enhanced with **Differential Privacy (DP)**.  
It enables multiple clients (e.g., hospitals, banks, or smart devices) to collaboratively train machine learning models **without sharing raw data**, ensuring **security, anonymity, and compliance** with data protection standards.  

---

## ✅ **Key Capabilities**
- 🤝 **Federated Training** – Clients train locally and share only model updates.  
- 🔒 **Differential Privacy** – Adds calibrated noise to updates to protect sensitive data.  
- 📡 **Scalable Architecture** – Supports multiple distributed clients.  
- 🧩 **Modular Design** – Easy to extend for healthcare, finance, or IoT domains.  
- 📊 **Analytics & Monitoring** – Logs performance and privacy metrics during training.

## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**

**ShadowFed’s architecture** balances collaboration with strong privacy guarantees.  

- **Client Nodes** – Hold private datasets, perform local training, and add DP noise.  
- **Privacy Layer** – Implements **Differential Privacy** before sending updates.  
- **Server Aggregator** – Combines client updates using **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**.  
- **Global Model** – A privacy-preserving, collaboratively trained model is shared back to clients.  

```

Client Nodes      → Local training on private data
Privacy Layer     → DP noise addition to gradients/weights
Server Aggregator → Federated Averaging of model updates
Global Model      → Shared, privacy-preserving model for all clients
